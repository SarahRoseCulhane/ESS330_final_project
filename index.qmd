# Proposal #1

**Title:** Testing for a relationship between migratory shorebird abundance during stopovers at wetland habitats and anthropogenic externalities on local-scale wetland conditions.

**Justification:** Wetlands provide critical stopover habitat for many migratory bird species to rest and replenish energy reserves needed for them to complete their migration. In the Northern Great plains, wetlands are particularly important for migratory shorebirds, providing stopover for birds that breed in northern parts of the Great Plains, the boreal forest, and Arctic tundra. However, the Great Plains has experienced a large amount of wetland loss from numerous anthropogenic factors, with agricultural conversion having the largest impact (\@<https://doi.org/10.1002/wlb3.01132>). Currently, shorebird populations are declining, and while this is a widespread phenomenon, migratory species, most of which breed in the arctic and subarctic regions during the boreal summer and migrate to to temporal and tropical areas during the non-breeding season, are being hit harder than most (\@colwell2010shorebird). The ultimate cause of this is unknown, but what is known is that humans have expanded their use of coastal ecosystems in recent years, impacting shorebirds in numerous ways, such as the claiming of intertidal and supratidal spaces. (\@article), warranting more research on the impact of anthropogenic externalities on shorebird abundance.

**Research Objective/question/hypothesis:** In this study, I aim to test the hypothesis that there is a relationship between local anthropogenic forces surrounding wetlands in the Northern Great Plains and the abundance of migratory shorebird species within those wetlands.

**Proposed Methods:** To carry out this study, I plan to use data from “Associations with landscape and local-scale wetland habitat conditions vary among migratory shorebird species during stopovers”. For this study, researchers used shorebird abundance data for 16 different shorebird species by collecting surveys on wetlands during spring and fall migration from fall 2007 to spring 2009 in ten counties in north-central Oklahoma, USA, which was published to dryad. Their goal was to identify and compare the associate of observed abundance and with within-wetland characteristics to gain a better understanding of habitat requirement. For this project, I plan to cut down the data to just the year 2009 and use surrounding wetland characteristics (surrounding slope surrounding habitat, land context, ect). The data set includes individual species abundance, total migrating shorebirds (i.e., excluding locally breeding species) abundance, and shorebird abundance. I plan to look at only shorebird abundance to make things easier. For variables that have numerical data, I plan to use a t-test to compare the means, seeing if I can predict whether any predictor variables are statistically significant. Additionally, I plan on using the chi-squared to test to determine if any predictor variables are independent of shorebird abundance.

\
**Expected Outcomes:** I expect that there will be a negative relationship between anthropogenic forces and shorebird abundance, with shorebird abundance decreasing as surrounding wetland anthropogenic forces, such as cultivation and infrastructure, increases

# Proposal #2

**Title:** Assessing the influence of riparian zones on taxonomic richness in Crater Lake National Park

**Justification:** Riparian zones are integral to the health of freshwater ecosystems, providing essential ecosystem services and contributing greatly to their adjacent ecosystems despite representing a narrow portion of the landscape.They are often associated with better watershed health through their ability to buffer pollutants, protect against erosion, and provide habitat for a variety of species, increasing species richness (Sabo et al., 2005). In freshwater ecosystems, benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently used in water quality monitoring as indicators of health, as many species are sensitive to pollution or habitat modification. Because of their tolerance to pollution, the presence and dominance of macroinvertebrates in orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies), often referred to as EPT, generally indicates good water health. The dominance of macroinvertebrates tolerant to pollutants, such as leeches and midge larva, indicates poor water health (McDonald et al., 1991). However, riparian zones are constantly being threatened by humans, and the degradation of them could prove harmful to their adjacent ecosystems, in part due to their influence on taxonomic richness, facilitating the need for more research on the area.

**Research Objective/question/hypothesis:** In this study, I aim to test the influence of riparian zones on macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness and distribution in lakes and ponds at Crater Lake National Park. Intact riparian zones are generally associated with higher macroinvertebrate populations and diversity and healthier waterbodies, and a high abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies). Because of this, I hypothesize that waterbodies with more intact riparian zones will have a higher number of EPT benthic macroinvertebrates than water bodies with less intact riparian zones. 

**Proposed methods:** For this project, I propose looking at two datasets provided by the Klamath Lakes Monitoring Data Package 2013-2019, which contains monitoring data for lakes and ponds at Crater Lake NP, Lassen Volcanic NP, and Redwood NSP. The datasets I am planning on using are InvertSpecies.csv, which holds data about species detected during invertebrate surveys, and RiparianCover.csv, which holds data about riparian cover at 15 semi equidistant points around the lake. Looking at both datasets, they both have the columns “Unit_Code”, “Park_Name”, “Lake_Code”, and “Start_date”, with a lot of the same information in the columns for both datasets. This, along with the fact that both datasets are part of the same data package and overarching project, tells me that the area that the data was collected was the same for both datasets, with some exceptions where data was collected for one set but not the other. To narrow down the scope, I plan to use just the data from Crater Lake National Park in the year 2018 in both data sets. As for the invertebrate dataset, I plan on filtering the data to just include the columns mentioned before as well as order and life stage, filtering the data to just invertebrates collected in the larva stage with no damage. I plan on cutting the riparian vegetation data to the appropriate columns as well and joining the two datasets, looking at each lake code and performing the appropriate tests to figure out what orders of macroinvertebrates were present in that waterbody and what the riparian cover looked like, drawing conclusions that either prove or disprove my hypothesis.

**Expected outcomes:** I expect that results will support my hypothesis, disproving the null hypothesis that there is no association between benthic macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness and riparian cover in Crater Lake National Park.
