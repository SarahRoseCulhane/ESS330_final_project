abstract = {Wetlands provide many ecosystem services and functions, including critical stopover habitat for numerous migratory bird species. Yet, loss and degradation of wetlands due to land use and land cover changes have greatly reduced wetland extent worldwide, leading to declines of many migratory shorebirds globally. In the Western Hemisphere, wetlands of the North American Great Plains provide important stopover habitat for shorebirds; however, much remains to be learned about shorebird habitat use during stopovers in this region, including species-specific associations with landscape-scale wetland availability and characteristics of individual wetlands. To improve understanding of shorebird habitat use during migration, we conducted shorebird surveys at > 14 000 wetlands throughout Oklahoma, USA, from 2007 to 2009. For 16 shorebird species, we analyzed associations between observed abundance and wetland variables, including within-wetland characteristics and availability of wetlands at multiple spatial scales surrounding survey locations. We found that the scale at which observed abundance of shorebirds was associated with wetland extent varied among species; 10 species responded most strongly to wetland extent at the 500 m scale, but 5 species and 1 species responded most strongly at 1000 and 2000 m scales, respectively. Observed abundance for most species was generally associated with higher wetland density at broad scales, presence of extensive shallow water, more usable area, and limited vegetation within wetlands, yet there was considerable interspecific variation in the strength and in some cases direction of effects of these within-wetland characteristics. This interspecies variability highlights the importance of conserving a variety of wetland types with differing characteristics that support the entire shorebird community during migration. By informing optimal habitat requirements for shorebirds during a critical stage of their annual cycle, knowledge gained about species-specific habitat needs from studies like ours can assist with development of conservation and management strategies that contribute to halting and reversing global shorebird declines.},

abstract = {Riparian zones are habitats of critical conservation concern worldwide, as they are known to filter agricultural contaminants, buffer landscapes against erosion, and provide habitat for high numbers of species. Here we test the generality of the notion that riparian habitats harbor more species than adjacent upland habitats. Using previously published data collected from seven continents and including taxa ranging from Antarctic soil invertebrates to tropical rain forest lianas and primates, we show that riparian habitats do not harbor higher numbers of species, but rather support significantly different species pools altogether. In this way, riparian habitats increase regional (γ-) richness across the globe by >50\%, on average. Thus conservation planners can easily increase the number of species protected in a regional portfolio by simply including a river within terrestrial biodiversity reserves. Our analysis also suggests numerous possible improvements for future studies of species richness gradients across riparian and upland habitats. First, <15\% of the studies in our analysis included estimates of more than one taxonomic group of interest. Second, within a given taxonomic group, studies employed variable methodologies and sampling areas in pursuit of richness and turnover estimates. Future analyses of species richness patterns in watersheds should aim to include a more comprehensive suite of taxonomic groups and should measure richness at multiple spatial scales.},
